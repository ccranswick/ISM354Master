## Markbook.js uses the basic readline function and a basic dictionary.
# Specification
> This assignment will give you further practice in writing simple JavaScript console applications with Node.js. It will extend your ability to adapt to new code situations and environments. In addition to control flow, this assignment will test your ability to use different operators. Start by confirming you understand simple control structures and how to write a Node application for execution on the command line. Answer each of these questions in the file operators.js (all in the same file) and commit this file to your assignment Git repo.
> 
> * (1) Declare a variable x with the value of 0.
> * (2) Use both the prefix and postfix increment operators (++) to increment the value of x and print out the results.
> * (2) Now use these operators as part of an if statement (ie: if (x++ === ???) and if(++x === ???)) to further your
understanding. Use the body of the if statement to print a suitable message.
> * (5) Create a file operators.md and (using markdown) explain how the two increment operators work based on your
observations.
> * (10) Copy your markbook.js file from the previous assignment and commit it. Now modify it to include the following
new features. Add a feature to print out the mode of the marks in the markbook. You will need to investigate what this means and identify a method for calculating it in JavaScript. Also add error handling in your code to ensure that all marks are in the inclusive range of 0 to 100.

> TAKE NOTE: This assignment is due on Monday 3 September, but you will NOT have the Friday 31 August practical to work on it.
