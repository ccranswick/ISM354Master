## Markbook.js uses the basic readline function

## Markbook2.js uses a recursive function

# Specification
> This assignment will give you practice in writing simple JavaScript console applications with Node.js. It will also test
> your ability to adapt to new code situations and environments. You should be familiar with control flow structures as well
> as JavaScript data structures for this assignment.
> Start by confirming you understand simple control structures and how to write a Node application  for execution on the
> command line. Answer each of these questions in the file control.js (all in the same file) and commit this file to your
> assignment Git repo. You can run Node on the file in the Terminal with the command node control.js. You can print to the terminal with the console.log(”string”) function call.
> * (3) Write a while loop that counts from 1 to 10 and prints out each value along the way.
> * (3) Write a for loop which performs the same task as (1) above.
> * (3) Write a second for loop which also counts from 1 to 10 but prints out only the even values.
> * (6) Prompt a user for their age and print out a different message if they are over 18 or not.
>  
> You can read from the terminal with the readline package which is part of Node.js. You will need to learn a little about the readline module
> to do so (https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html). Note that the documentation includes an example at the
> top which is sufficient for this exercise, but it is worth reading the entire documentation. We will study callbacks in
> more detail in another assignment.
> * (15) Having completed the above simple exercises, now attempt to write a simple console markbook using Node.js. You should repeatedly prompt the user for a students marks until they type a control keyword average which prints the average. Thereafter the program should accept more marks. If the user types exit, your program should terminate. 
> 
> You should store this program in the file markbook.js in your Git repo and you should commit regularly so that the marker can see how your attempt has evolved over time. A significant percentage of your mark is awarded to your attempt rather than your solution.
