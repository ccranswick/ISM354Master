# <a name="INTRO"></a> INTRODUCTION
Before we begin its important to understand what an architectural pattern is. 

An architectual pattern is a predeveloped broad scoped approach to software development in order to deal with common issues experienced by programmers.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Viewmodel (MVVM) are two common examples of architectual patterns.

This is important to understand when delving into web applications as these patterns define how the web application will be built.

This architectual pattern segments an application into three related and interconnected components. This segmentation encourages and allows for simultaneous development as well as code reuse.

The three components all differ in function and form, these components are namely Model, View and Controller. The model component manages the data of the application, it recieves input from the controller and then updates the view. The view component manages the representation of the data for user interpretation. The controller manages user input and converts this into commands for the model to interpret. The user therefore only interacts with the view and controller component. This is important as it defines how and where graphical user interfaces (GUI) will be developed.

As a result of this pattern incorporating user input, its traditionally used for desktop GUIs, web applications and mobile clients.
